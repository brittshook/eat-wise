# Eat Wise

This website is an interactive prototype of a food and fitness concept service called Eat Wise. This project is part of the Per Scholas Software Engineering bootcamp and serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in HTML and CSS.


# Pages

Please be aware that not all links are functional, as only three pages have been coded at the moment:

- Home page
- Log In
- Create an Account 
  - Clicking on 'Get Started' links will direct you to this page


Please note the following:

## Log In
The Log In page is designed with multiple steps. Users can choose to log in via Google, Apple, or by entering their email address. However, only the email address option is operational in this prototype.

**Existing Users**: Users with existing accounts will be redirected to the login email/password screen. To experience this functionality, use the email existing@gmail.com as a sample input.

**New Users**: Those without accounts will be redirected to the create an account screen when entering an email address (other than existing@gmail.com). This flow will be displayed for any new email input.

## Create an Acccount
Please note that the Create an Account process is a multi-page form, consisting of two screens in this prototype.


# Next Steps 
There are some features that I was unable to implement within the given timeframe. One notable feature is the ability to displaying a profile picture once it is uploaded. The profile picture should be displayed within the on-screen placeholder circle. Unfortunately, this second step was not implemented in this prototype.
